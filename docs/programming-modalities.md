# Programming Modalities

:::tip
This is a simplified categorization of the multitude of ways you might be working as a dev
:::

The difference between these for me is *how focued your work on a requiremetn that the average business person would correlate with the requiremetns of the bussiness*, vs. *technical requirements*.

## Systems Programmer
Creating operating systems, databases, stateful services, all that jazz
Low level - C++, Rust, Go

## Framework or Library Programmer
- Framework - code that uses your code.
- Library - code that your code uses.

## Application Developer

Our work and our job is to: 
- Make the company more money
- Reduce liability

"Application" means to "apply" technology to solve a business requirement.
