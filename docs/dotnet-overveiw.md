## What is it?


In the past, There were two big languages that were available on microsoft -> visual basic and C++
- visual basic = it makes the easy stuff too easy and the hard stuff impossible
- C++ = even the easy stuff is hard but you can do ANYTHING

- Later on Java came along as the third option. Memory management is automatic and you can focus on your objects
- Microsofy rips off java and makes a magaged execution environment
    - java virtual machine = JVM, .NET Common Language Runtime (CLM)
    - Microsoft was working on "COOL" (C-Based Object Oriented Language) and that idea became C# (C++++)
    - Framework Class Library FCL

XML Web Services promised to be a way to represent any data without limiting you. "XML is like violence if it isn't working, you just need more of it"
Legend has it that some guy created XML Server Pages over some month (became ASP.Net). It was a tool for making web pages with C# and it became much easier to make web apps   


A solution is like a workspace and contains multiple projects
each project in VS compiles to an assembly
Note - the CLR is the program that runs your .NET Progrgams 


ildasm = a terminal command where you can open up a solution and find dll and executables. You can open the dlls and look through classes and methods. Can also look at disassembled code and see system calls ect. You can also click Manifest to read the program manifesto
    - he says intellisense uses this. maybe true
